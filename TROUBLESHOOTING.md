# Troubleshooting

**You don't open this app, it opens itself.** The only time you launch it by hand is once, right after install, so it can wire up the Claude Code hooks. After that it starts itself whenever a Claude Code session is running and quits when none is. So opening it from Finder or Spotlight with no session active can look like it launches and immediately quits. That is expected, not a crash: just start a Claude Code session and the icon appears on its own. Upgrades self-heal: drop the new version into Applications and it refreshes its own hooks the next time it starts up. (It relaunches itself when your next session begins, and on a version change it re-runs its installer automatically, so you never run anything by hand.)

**Updated (or just installed) while Claude Code sessions were already running?** Sessions already open appear the next time they do something (a prompt or a tool call), so the menu can look empty until then. Starting a new `claude` session also works. (On 0.4.0 and earlier, a new session was the only way; update if you're seeing that.)

**Using Chat or Cowork in the desktop app?** Those don't move the icon. Claude Code Chat and Cowork don't fire the same hooks this app runs on, so there's no live signal to drive the timer or the animation. Only Claude Code sessions move it: the desktop app's Code mode, or `claude` in a terminal. You'll still see the resting spark while the desktop app is open.

**Icon stuck on "thinking" in the terminal after you interrupted?** If you press Esc or Ctrl+C during the early thinking phase, before any output has streamed, Claude Code doesn't emit a signal for the app to catch, so the icon can sit on thinking until it times out (about 15 minutes). Sending any new prompt clears it right away. This one is terminal only, and it's an upstream Claude Code quirk, covered under [Known issues](#known-issues) below.

**Icon disappeared weeks ago and never came back?** If you installed Node via Homebrew, versions before 0.4.2 wrote a version-specific Node path into the hooks, and a `brew upgrade node` broke them silently. Fixed in 0.4.2: update the app and launch it once, and the hooks repair themselves.

**Icon stuck on "thinking" in the desktop app?** If a session hits your usage limit mid-turn, Claude Code fires no hook to close it out, so the icon keeps thinking until it times out (about 15 minutes). To clear it right away, click the icon in the menu bar and choose **Quit**.

**The icon doesn't appear at all?**
- Make sure a Claude session is actually running, not just a terminal window open. Start a new session (or restart Claude Code) and the bar appears automatically.
- A session that was already running *before* you installed won't show up until you start a fresh session.
- Confirm it's running with `pgrep -x ClaudeStatusBar`: a number means it's running (it may just be hidden), no output means it exited because no Claude session is active.
- If first-launch setup never took, run the installer manually: `node "/Applications/ClaudeStatusBar.app/Contents/Resources/install.js"`

**Installed via Homebrew?** Everything brew-specific (install, updates, the v0.4.0 rename transition, brew errors) lives in [HOMEBREW.md](HOMEBREW.md).

**Seeing 2 icons?** The desktop app shows its own menu bar icon (the quick-screenshot one). To avoid two icons sitting side by side, open Claude's **Settings → General** and turn that built-in menu bar item off.

**Hooks acting up?** On either platform, set `CLAUDE_STATUSBAR_DEBUG=1` in the environment of a Claude Code session and read `~/.claude/statusbar/hooks.log`: every hook invocation is logged with its event and session.

## Linux

**No icon in the top bar?** The app is a StatusNotifierItem, so the desktop needs an AppIndicator host. Stock Ubuntu, KDE, and XFCE have one; vanilla GNOME (Debian, Fedora) needs the `gnome-shell-extension-appindicator` package enabled. Check the app itself with `pgrep -f claude-status-bar`, and inspect what it sees with `claude-status-bar --dump` (prints every live session and the aggregate as JSON).

**No timer or label next to the icon?** GNOME renders the AppIndicator label; some desktops (KDE among them) show only the icon. The per-session timers in the dropdown work everywhere.

**Clicking a session row does nothing.** On macOS a row click raises the Claude app or the session's terminal; raising a specific window isn't portable across Wayland compositors, so Linux rows are display-only for now.

**Using `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`?** The hooks are written into the `settings.json` that Claude Code actually reads, resolved from `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at install time. Run the first launch (or `node /usr/share/claude-status-bar/hooks/install.js`) from a shell with the same environment your Claude Code sessions use.

**No desktop notifications?** The Notifications menu only appears when libnotify is present (`sudo apt install gir1.2-notify-0.7`), and popups also need a notification daemon: desktop environments run one, minimal Sway/Hyprland setups add one (mako, dunst). The mode is off by default; turn it on from the icon's menu.

**Auto color picked ink you can't see?** Auto is white on GNOME and follows the XDG portal / gsettings color scheme elsewhere; a panel themed against its desktop's scheme can defeat it. Pick White or Black manually, which is why they stay in the menu.

**No completion sound?** The chime plays through GStreamer. `sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0` and restart the app; without GStreamer the Completion Sound menu simply doesn't appear.

## Known issues

**Interrupting during the reasoning phase (CLI only) can freeze the icon on "thinking".** If you hit Ctrl+C while a turn is still in the extended-thinking phase, before any answer text has streamed, Claude Code writes nothing to the transcript and fires no hook, so there's no signal for the app to react to. The session sits on "thinking" until the 15-minute cap.
- Clears instantly if you type a new prompt in that session or close the terminal.
- Interrupting *after* answer text starts streaming recovers normally, within a poll.
- The desktop app is unaffected. Root cause is upstream in Claude Code, not fixable from here.

**Clicking a session brings the app forward, not the exact session.** Desktop sessions raise the Claude app rather than that specific conversation; terminal sessions raise your terminal app rather than that window or tab. Exact terminal focus needs a one-time Automation permission grant and lives in a test build ([#19](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/19)).

**The app launches and tracks sessions inside Cursor.** Cursor's Third-party skills feature reads the same `~/.claude/settings.json` and runs your hooks against its own agent, so Cursor sessions show up here too. Most things work (spark, timer, rows); the amber permission dot, the CLI/APP pill and click-to-focus don't, because Cursor doesn't pass those events. To turn it off, disable **Third-party skills** in Cursor's Settings → Features. Your Claude Code usage is unaffected.
